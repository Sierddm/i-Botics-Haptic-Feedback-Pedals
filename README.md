# i-Botics-Haptic-Feedback-Pedals

This repository contains both the ROS package and the code for the RaMstix for controlling the haptic feedback capable pedals in the cockpit.
The ROS package also contains a node for using the pedals in combination with a TurtleBot in Gazebo. 

Instructions on how to run the demonstration are documented in the ROS package. 

**Note:**
The RaMstix makes use of an altered Makefile, anything to do with XENOMAI is removed from this version.
